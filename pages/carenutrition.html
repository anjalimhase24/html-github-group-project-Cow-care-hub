        <h3><u>Why Cow Care Matters?</u></h3>
    </center>
    <p>Cows are <b>gentle animals</b> that silently support human life by providing milk, natural farming support, and
        ecological balance. They depend entirely on humans for their safety, comfort, and well-being. Proper cow care is
        not just a responsibility - <b>it is an act of compassion.</b>When cows receive <b>clean shelter, fresh water, medical
        attention, and gentle handling,</b> they live healthier and stress-free lives. A well-cared cow is more active,
        disease-free, and emotionally calm. Neglect, poor shelter, or harsh treatment can cause pain, illness, and fear,
        affecting both their health and productivity. Caring for cows reflects our values as humans. By protecting and
        caring for them, we preserve <b>compassion, tradition, and a sustainable future.</b> Every small act of care —
        cleanliness, kindness, and attention — makes a big difference in a cow's life.</p>

        <h3><u>Why Cow Nutrition Matters?</u></h3>
    </center>
    <p>Nutrition is the <b>foundation of a cow's health and strength.</b> Just like humans, cows need balanced and nutritious
        food to stay healthy, active, and happy. Proper nutrition helps cows grow well, fight diseases, and produce
        quality milk. A cow that receives the right mix of <b>green fodder, dry fodder, clean water, and essential minerals</b>
        remains energetic and comfortable. Poor or insufficient nutrition can lead to weakness, illness, low milk yield,
        and long-term health problems.</p>

        <h3><u>Health, Hygiene & Calf Care</u></h3>
    </center>
    <p>Proper health and hygiene are essential to keep cows safe, healthy, and comfortable. Clean sheds, fresh feeding
        areas, and regular vaccination help protect cows from diseases and infections. Daily observation and timely
        veterinary check-ups allow early detection of health problems, while isolating sick cows prevents illness from
        spreading. Calves need extra care as they are delicate; giving colostrum immediately after birth builds strong
        immunity. A warm, clean shelter, balanced diet, regular health checks, and gentle handling help calves grow
        healthy, strong, and stress-free.</p>
