                Veterinary Assistance – Detailed Information
            </u>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Veterinary assistance is essential for ensuring timely medical care and preventing serious health problems in cows. Regular observation and early action can reduce disease spread and improve overall productivity. Cow owners should understand when basic care is sufficient and when professional veterinary help is required.
        </p>
        <h3>
            When to Observe the Cow
        </h3>
        <p>
            Some health changes may be minor and can be observed for a short time. These include mild tiredness, temporary change in appetite, or slight decrease in activity. During this stage, proper rest, clean water, and monitoring are important.
        </p>
        <h3>
            When to Contact a Veterinarian
        </h3>
        <p>
            A veterinarian should be contacted if the cow shows serious symptoms such as continuous high fever, refusal to eat, difficulty in walking or standing, severe diarrhea, injury, swelling, or sudden drop in milk production. These signs indicate that medical attention is necessary.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Emergency Situations
        </h3>
        <p>
            Immediate veterinary help is required in critical cases such as severe injury, poisoning, calving complications, uncontrolled bleeding, or sudden collapse. Delaying treatment in these situations can be life-threatening.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Preventive Role of Veterinary Care
        </h3>
        <p>
            Veterinary assistance also focuses on disease prevention. Regular vaccination, deworming, clean shelter, proper hygiene, and routine health checkups help protect cows from infections and long-term illnesses.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How CowCare Hub Supports Veterinary Assistance
        </h3>
        <p>
            CowCare Hub provides basic veterinary guidance to help cow owners understand common health problems and recognize early warning signs. The platform encourages timely action and promotes awareness about preventive care, helping farmers make informed decisions and maintain healthy livestock.

        <h2 align="center">
            <u>Health Check Guidance – Detailed Information</u>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Health check guidance focuses on regular monitoring of a cow’s physical condition
            and daily behavior. Routine health checks help in identifying early signs of illness
            and prevent minor health issues from becoming serious problems.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Daily Health Observation
        </h3>
        <p>
            Cow owners should observe the cow’s eating habits, water intake, movement,
            and activity level on a daily basis. Changes in appetite, weakness,
            or unusual behavior may indicate health problems.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Physical Condition Monitoring
        </h3>
        <p>
            Regularly checking the cow’s body condition, coat quality, eyes, and posture
            helps in understanding overall health. Healthy cows usually appear active
            and alert with a normal body posture.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Milk Production and Behavior
        </h3>
        <p>
            Monitoring milk yield and milking behavior is important, as a sudden drop
            in milk production can be an early sign of illness, stress, or nutritional imbalance.
        </p>

        <h3>
            When to Take Action
        </h3>
        <p>
            If symptoms such as continuous weakness, fever, limping, swelling,
            or abnormal discharge are noticed, immediate attention is required.
            Early action helps prevent serious health conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Importance of Regular Health Checks
        </h3>
        <p>
            Regular health checks reduce disease risk, improve productivity,
            and support long-term cow welfare. Consistent monitoring helps
            cow owners maintain healthy and productive livestock.

            <u>Nutrition Support – Detailed Information</u>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Nutrition support focuses on providing a balanced and healthy diet to cows
            based on their age, breed, and production needs. Proper nutrition is essential
            for maintaining good health, improving immunity, and increasing productivity.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Importance of Balanced Nutrition
        </h3>
        <p>
            A balanced diet helps cows maintain body strength, resist diseases,
            and support normal growth and milk production. Lack of proper nutrition
            can lead to weakness, low milk yield, and health issues.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Feeding Based on Age and Breed
        </h3>
        <p>
            Nutritional requirements vary depending on the cow’s age and breed.
            Calves, adult cows, and lactating cows require different types and
            quantities of feed to meet their nutritional needs.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Types of Feed
        </h3>
        <p>
            A healthy diet includes green fodder, dry fodder, concentrates,
            mineral supplements, and clean drinking water. Each component
            plays an important role in maintaining cow health.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Role of Nutrition in Productivity
        </h3>
        <p>
            Proper nutrition directly affects milk production, reproductive health,
            and overall performance. Well-nourished cows produce better-quality
            milk and remain active and healthy.
        </p>

        </h3>
        <p>

            <u>Disease Awareness – Detailed Information</u>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Disease awareness helps cow owners understand common diseases
            and recognize early symptoms in cows. Early identification of
            health problems helps in prevention and reduces serious health risks.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Common Diseases in Cows
        </h3>
        <p>
            Cows may suffer from diseases such as fever, mastitis,
            foot and mouth disease, digestive infections, and parasitic diseases.
            Awareness of these diseases helps in timely care.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Early Symptoms to Observe
        </h3>
        <p>
            Early symptoms include loss of appetite, fever, weakness,
            limping, swelling, diarrhea, coughing, or sudden drop in milk production.
            Observing these signs helps in early action.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Importance of Early Detection
        </h3>
        <p>
            Early detection of diseases prevents the condition from becoming severe
            and helps avoid the spread of infection to other cows.
            It also reduces treatment cost and recovery time.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Disease Prevention Measures
        </h3>
        <p>
            Preventive measures include regular vaccination, proper hygiene,
            clean shelter, clean drinking water, and isolation of sick cows
            to prevent disease spread.
        </p>

        <h3>
            How CowCare Hub Promotes Disease Awareness
        </h3>

            preventive practices. The platform helps cow owners recognize
            warning signs early and encourages timely veterinary support
