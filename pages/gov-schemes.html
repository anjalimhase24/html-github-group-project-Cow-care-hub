    <p>
        Government schemes play an important role in supporting cow owners, farmers, and the dairy sector in India. These schemes are introduced by the government to improve cow health, protect indigenous breeds, increase milk production, and provide financial and technical support to farmers. Through these schemes, farmers receive assistance in healthcare, nutrition, breeding, and dairy development, which helps improve their livelihood and animal welfare.
